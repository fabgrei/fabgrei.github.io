<p><strong>Falling Behind: Has Rising Inequality Fueled the American Debt Boom 1980&ndash;2007?</strong> &ndash; <strong><em>Job market paper</em></strong> (joint with Moritz Drechsel-Grau) <a href="/falling-behind/">[paper]</a></p>

<p>Abstract:
<em>The U.S. household debt boom since 1980 is considered one of the main drivers of
the Great Recession of 2007–9. In lockstep with household debt, income inequality has
risen to new extremes. We build a model that links rising inequality to the mortgage
debt boom. It builds on the idea that households care about their social status. To
keep up with the ever richer Joneses, the middle class substitutes status-enhancing
houses for status-neutral consumption. These houses are mortgage-financed, creating
a debt boom across the income distribution. Using a stylized model we show ana-
lytically that aggregate debt increases as top incomes rise. In a quantitative general
equilibrium model we show that “Keeping up with the Joneses” and rising income in-
equality generate sizable booms in mortgage debt and house prices. By contrast, the Global Saving Glut hypothesis gives rise to a similar debt boom, but has a much weaker effect on house prices.</em></p>

<p><strong>Understanding Housing Wealth Effects: Debt, Homeownership and the Lifecycle</strong> (joint with Frederick Zadow)</p>

<p>Abstract: <em>Housing wealth effects—the reaction of consumption to changes in house
prices—were at the heart of the Great Recession in the US. We provide a closed form
expression for housing wealth effects in tractable lifecycle model with
housing and mortgages. We show that the effects are stronger for homeowners that are
older or have stronger preferences for housing. Contrary to previous empirical
literature there is an ambiguous effect of indebtedness. We argue how our structural
model can still generate these reduced form findings. Renters do not react to
house prices in our model. This means hat aggregate housing wealth effects are proportional to the
homeownership rate. A numerical example suggests that housing wealth effects can explain 30 % of the boom
and all of the bust in non-durable consumption. 7% of this can be explained
by the boom and bust in homeownership rates.</em></p>
